    <h1>Basic of the Web and HTML</h1>

    <h2>The Web</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>w</b>orld <b>w</b>ide <b>w</b>eb is a collection of pages. The pages are stored as files in HTML format
        on servers around the world. Servers are dedicated computers which are optimized for HTTP transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web pages have a visual representation and can be accessed by a human using a special computer program called
        a web-browser. <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> is an example of a popular web page used for
        searching the web. There are billions of pages on the web, many of them linking to other web pages.
      </p>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is a programming language which programmers use in order to describe the visual structure and format
      of a web page. HTML is used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to create the full representation and
      experience of a web page. HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic programming constructs in HTML are tags. Tags can be used for text formatting (<b>bold</b>,
      <em>italic</em>, <u>underline</u>, etc.), for structuring text into paragraphs, for inserting images and for
      many other purposes. Tags may have attributes, which break down mandatory and optional "blanks" that the
      programmer needs to "fill out". There are many different HTML tags, and
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">this</a> is a good
      reference listing all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tag forms an element. The element is the resulting object displayed by the browser when it parses the tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elements can be "inline" (like a line break) or "block" (like a paragraph). Block elements have an invisible
      box surrounding them which affects the way text and objects inside the element are rendered to the screen.
